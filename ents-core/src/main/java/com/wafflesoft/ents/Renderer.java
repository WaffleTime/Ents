/**
 * A Renderer is responsible for drawing an entity when the
 * {@link Entity#draw(Object)} method is invoked on a visible Entity. When an
 * Entity is created with a view that has this Renderer, the Renderer of the
 * Entity is set to the Renderer that's returned by {@link #create(Entity)}.
 * When the Entity is deleted or the Renderer changes (due to a view change or
 * a manual Renderer change through {@link Entity#setRenderer(Renderer)}), the
 * {@link #destroy(Entity)} method is invoked. <br/>
 * <br/>
 * {@link #begin(Entity, Object)} and {@link #end(Entity, Object)} are invoked
 * depending on the Entity implementation. If the Entity implementation has a
 * set of entities, most likely {@link #begin(Entity, Object)} will be called,
 * all sub-entities will be drawn, and finally {@link #end(Entity, Object)} will
 * be called. <br/>
 * <br/>
 * It's common for the {@link #create(Entity)} method to return the reference
 * to this Renderer. Renderer implementations that don't have Entity specific
 * rendering information don't need to create a new instance of a Renderer.
